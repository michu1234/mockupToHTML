# mockupToHTML
HTML/CSS project, based on JPG mock-up
=======================================



Simple HTML/CSS excercise, testing skills in building responsive, grid layouts, without using any grid systems, such as Bootstrap, Foundation etc. I decided to use flexbox technology, instead of new (and more powerful) "CSS grid". This decision is based on not the best browser support, and necessity of useing some kind of polyfill. 

All CSS code was built with Drupal methodology, combining both SMACSS and BEM standards.
